## DN404 AMM MARKETPLACE

### Introduce Of DN404 
DN404 is an implementation of a co-joined ERC20 and ERC721 pair.Transfers on one side will be reflected on the other side.Compared with ERC404, it is full compliance with ERC20 and ERC721 specifications.

### DN404 Problem
Now the way users interact with DN404 is generally independently, for example swap token on dex like uniswap and list nft order on marketplace like opensea.

### Solution
Create a one-stop platform dedicated to its transactions. Users can easily exchange tokens and nfts here. In a pool, 2 DN404(4 assets) will be matched, users can swap their DN404 through erc20 or erc721 to another DN404's erc20 or erc721.Generally, users are more wulling to purchase and retain erc721 with high rarity , while users are more willing to consume erc20 with normal rarity.So to be more funny, when user try to swap to erc20 from pool, it is a normal swap rate base on swap rate, and when user try to swap to erc721 from pool, the exchange rate will be larger than it. 

### Market Expectation
This mixer marketplace is suitable for the exchange of equipment in some games. For example, users may need both DN404 assets. Usually they keep the one with better rarity and consume the other common ones as tokens.
